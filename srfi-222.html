<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Compound objects are analogous to R6RS compound conditions,
and are suitable for use in creating and handling conditions
on non-R6RS systems, among other purposes.
They encapsulate an immutable sequence of subobjects, which can be
any object except another compound object.
It is possible to implement R6RS compound conditions on top of
compound objects, but not vice versa.
Note that this SRFI does not provide any analogue to R6RS
<i>simple</i> conditions, which are just records.

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

None at this time.

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Compound objects serve as a kind of poor man's multiple inheritance
without the usual complications of multiple inheritance.
A compound object can
be used to represent multiple otherwise unrelated aspects of a value
or situation.
Because they are sequences, they can be used to
represent priorities of interpretation from higher to lower.  Most
of the operations described
in this section treat a non-compound object identically to a compound
object with the simple object as its sole component.</p>


<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<h3>Procedures</h3>
<p><code>(make-compound </code> <em>obj</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Create a compound object
containing the objects in <em>obj...</em> in the specified order.
If any object in <em>obj...</em> is itself a compound object,
it is flattened into its subobjects,
which are then added to the compound object in sequence.

<p><code>(compound-ref </code><em>obj k</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> is a compound object, returns the <em>k</em>th subobject.

zero, or greater than or equal to <code>(compound-length </code><em>obj</em><code>)</code>.</p>

the order in which <em>mapper</em> is applied to them is unspecified.
If any resulting subobject is itself a compound object, it is flattened into its subobjects,

Although the elements of the result are in the same order as the subobjects of <em>obj</em>,
the order in which <em>mapper</em> is applied to them is unspecified.</p>

<p>Returns a compound object
It contains the subobjects of <em>obj</em> that satisfy <em>pred</em>.</p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> is not a compound object, it returns a compound object.
If <em>obj</em> satisfies <em>pred</em>, the only subobject of the result is <em>obj</em>.
If <em>obj</em> does not satisfy <em>pred</em>, the result has no subobjects.</p>

<p><code>(compound-predicate pred obj </code><em>pred</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>If <em>obj</em> satisfies <em>pred</em>,
or is a compound object and
at least one of its subobjects satisfies <em>pred</em>,
then returns <code>#t</code>; otherwise returns <code>#f</code>.

<p>If <em>obj</em> satisfies <em>obj</em>, <em>accessor</em> is applied to
<em>obj</em> and the result is returned.
Otherwise, if <em>obj</em> is a compound object, <em>accessor is applied to
the first subobject that satisfies </em>obj</em>, and the result is returned.
Otherwise, <em>default</em> is returned.
