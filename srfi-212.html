<p>by John Cowan (text), Arvydas Silanskas (implementation)</p>


<p>Compound objects are a generalization of R6RS compound conditions,
and are suitable for use in creating and handling conditions among other purposes.
They encapsulate an immutable sequence of subobjects, which can be
any object except another compound object.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

None at this time.

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>Compound objects serve as a kind of poor man's multiple inheritance
without the usual complications of multiple inheritance.
A compound object can
be used to represent multiple otherwise unrelated aspects of a value
or situation.
They can be stand-alone or belong to a type (designated by a symbol).
Because they are sequences, they can be used to
represent priorities of interpretation from higher to lower.  Most
of the operations described
in this section treat a simple condition identically to a compound
condition with itself as its own sole component.</p>


<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
<p>When a compound object is created, a type for it may be specified:
this is either a symbol or <code>#f</code>, meaning that the object has no type.
Associated key-value properties are also specified in the form of an alist.
It is an error to mutate any list passed to or returned from these procedures.</p>
<h3>Procedures</h3>
<p><code>(make-compound </code> <em>typesym alist obj</em> ...<code>)</code></p>
<p>Create a compound object whose type is <em>typesym</em>
and whose properties are in <em>props</em>.
It contains the objects in <em>list</em> in the specified order.
If any object in <em>list</em> is itself a compound object,
it is flattened into its subobjects,
which are then added to the compound object in sequence.

<p>If <em>obj</em> is a compound object, <em>accessor</em> is applied to
the first subobject of <em>obj</em> that satisfies <em>pred</em> and the result is returned;

<p>If <em>obj</em> is not a compound object, then if the object satisfies <em>pred</em>,
it applies <em>accessor</em> to <em>obj</em> and returns what it returns.
